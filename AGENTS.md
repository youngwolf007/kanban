# The Project Management MVP web app

## Business Requirements

This project is building a Project Management App. Key features:
- A user can sign in
- When signed in, the user sees a Kanban board representing their project
- The Kanban board has fixed columns that can be renamed
- The cards on the Kanban board can be moved with drag and drop, and edited
- There is an AI chat feature in a sidebar; the AI is able to create / edit / move one or more cards

## Limitations

For the MVP, there will only be a user sign in (hardcoded to 'user' and 'password') but the database will support multiple users for future.

For the MVP, there will only be 1 Kanban board per signed in user.

For the MVP, this will run locally (in a docker container)

## Technical Decisions

- NextJS frontend
- Python FastAPI backend, including serving the static NextJS site at /
- Everything packaged into a Docker container
- Use "uv" as the package manager for python in the Docker container
- Use OpenRouter for the AI calls. An OPENROUTER_API_KEY is in .env in the project root
- Use `openai/gpt-oss-120b` as the model
- Use SQLLite local database for the database, creating a new db if it doesn't exist
- Start and Stop server scripts for Mac, PC, Linux in scripts/

## Starting Point

A working MVP of the frontend has been built and is already in frontend. This is not yet designed for the Docker setup. It's a pure frontend-only demo.

## Color Scheme

- Accent Yellow: `#ecad0a` - accent lines, highlights
- Blue Primary: `#209dd7` - links, key sections, non-text UI (borders, icons, backgrounds)
- Blue Primary (text): `#0e7490` - the same blue used as actual text; `#209dd7` is 3.06:1
  on white, below the 4.5:1 AA bar for text, though it clears the 3:1 non-text bar fine
- Purple Secondary: `#753991` - submit buttons, important actions
- Dark Navy: `#032147` - main headings
- Gray Text: `#6b6b6b` - supporting text, labels (was `#888888`, which is 3.54:1 on white,
  below the 4.5:1 AA bar; darkened until it cleared AA)

## Coding standards

1. Use latest versions of libraries and idiomatic approaches as of today
2. Keep it simple - NEVER over-engineer, ALWAYS simplify, NO unnecessary defensive programming. No extra features - focus on simplicity.
3. Be concise. Keep README minimal. IMPORTANT: no emojis ever
4. When hitting issues, always identify root cause before trying a fix. Do not guess. Prove with evidence, then fix the root cause.

## Working documentation

Reference documentation for the current system lives in the docs/ directory and in each
directory's own `AGENTS.md`. Start with `CLAUDE.md` in the project root.
